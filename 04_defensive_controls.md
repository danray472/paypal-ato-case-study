# üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Controls & Recommendations

## ‚úÖ For Users

1. **Enable 2FA Immediately**  
   - Always turn on 2FA yourself before an attacker can do it for you

2. **Use a Unique Password for Every Account**  
   - Use a password manager like Bitwarden, 1Password, or even Google Passwords

3. **Review Sessions & Devices Regularly**  
   - In Gmail, GitHub, and PayPal ‚Äî check for unknown logins

4. **Monitor Forwarding Rules (in Email)**  
   - Some attackers add silent Gmail filters to hide alerts

5. **React Fast**  
   - As soon as you receive alerts, reset passwords or remove suspicious devices

## üè¢ For Platforms (Like PayPal)

1. **Challenge All Sensitive Actions**  
   - Require re-authentication or MFA before:
     - Changing primary email
     - Enabling 2FA
     - Changing password

2. **Confirm Email Changes with the Original Address**  
   - Never allow silent email switching without alerting the old email

3. **Hold Period for Risky Changes**  
   - Enforce delays or review periods when email, 2FA, and password are changed in short time

4. **Log Visibility to Users**  
   - Show a full login/session history to help users detect breaches

5. **Better Alerting**  
   - Real-time push, SMS, and email alerts before changes are finalized
