## 📌 Project Overview

This project documents a **real account takeover attack** I experienced on my PayPal account. Despite having no funds in the account, the attacker performed a full takeover, changing the password, email, and adding their own 2FA — locking me out completely.

> This project aims to reconstruct the attack, identify security flaws in PayPal's flow, and reflect on the experience as a cybersecurity student transitioning from development.
